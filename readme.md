# 📊 Sales Analytics Data Warehouse Project

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics pipeline** built using SQL, covering:

* Data ingestion from multiple sources (CRM & ERP)
* Data warehousing using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Advanced SQL analytics (CTEs, window functions)
* Business-ready reporting

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows a **modern data warehouse architecture**:

* **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingestion from source systems
* **Silver Layer** → Data cleaning, transformation, and standardization
* **Gold Layer** → Business-ready dimensional model

## 🔄 Data Sources

### CRM System

* `cust_info.csv` → Customer details
* `prd_info.csv` → Product information
* `sales_details.csv` → Sales transactions

### ERP System

* `cust_az12.csv` → Customer data
* `loc_a101.csv` → Location data
* `px_cat_g1v2.csv` → Product category data

## ⚙️ Data Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Bronze Layer (Ingestion)

* Load raw CSV data from CRM & ERP
* Minimal transformation
* Preserve original structure

### 2️⃣ Silver Layer (Transformation)

* Data cleaning and validation
* Standardizing schemas across systems
* Handling nulls and inconsistencies
* Merging CRM and ERP datasets

### 3️⃣ Gold Layer (Modeling)

* Dimensional modeling (Star Schema):

  * `dim_customers`
  * `dim_products`
  * `fact_sales`
* Optimized for analytics and reporting

---

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Customer segmentation
* Revenue trends over time
* Product performance analysis
* Ranking and window function analysis

### 📈 Reports

* **Customer Report** → Insights on customer behavior
* **Product Performance Report** → Revenue and sales trends
